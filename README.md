# Hand-Gesture-Robot
A wireless robotic system that responds to hand gestures for intuitive motion control. The project uses an MPU6050 accelerometer/gyroscope to detect hand orientation and transmits data via nRF24L01 transceiver modules to a receiver Arduino that drives DC motors through an L293D motor driver.
